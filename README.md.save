Nanowire flask
==============
This library is designed to allow a python developer to easily create a nanowire plugin using the flask APIs structure.

The function you mount for image plugins, using the function ``mount_Image_function``  must have the arguments ``img`` and ``variables`` if you want initialise a model or other variables when the sever starts you may make the function to be mounted into a function of a 
class which is initiated with the function ``mount_Image_function``. You should expect ``img`` to be a PIL RGB image object and ``variables`` to be a dictionary containing the variables sent to the plugin in the curl request.

The function for mounting a text based plugin is similar however it is called ``mount_text_function`` and expects the arguments ``text`` and ``variables``.

The curl requests for images may be formatted 2 ways. The first involves sending the image as a file attached to the curl request. For example:

``curl -F "image=@./1.jpg" -XPOST http://0.0.0.0:5000/model/predict?threshold=0.5``

alternatively the file may be sent as a link using a dictionary eg.

``curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"contentUrl":"http://127.0.0.1:8000/1.jpg", "threshold":0.5}' http://0.0.0.0:5000/model/predict``

The currently supported image formats are:

* jpg
* png
* bmp
* tif
* ppm

The curl request for text is similar to that used for images except that it may take either raw text or a file containing raw text. You may either post a document containing the raw text using the command

``curl -F "doc=@./doc1.txt" -XPOST http://0.0.0.0:5000/model/predict?deactivate_ngrams=True``

or the raw text can be sent using:

``curl -X POST -H "Content-Type:application/json" -d '{"content":"Example text about whichever subject you're interested in", "deactivate_ngrams"="True"}' http://0.0.0.0:5000/model/predict``

This library will eventually be expanded to be able to handle video, sound and arbitary files however for now it is limited to text and images.

**Notes on debug mode**

In order to activate debug mode the environmental variable `PYTHON_DEBUG` must be set to true.

Debug mode will mean that any errors encountered whilst running the function will also return a full traceback in the returned JSON.

**Notes on taskID**

If the post contains ``taskID`` as an argument the taskID given will also be returned in the output JSON.
